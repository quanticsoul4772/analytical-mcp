# Test Optimization for API Dependencies

This document summarizes the optimizations made to resolve test issues with API dependencies.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Mock Implementations
- Deleted the `__mocks__` directory and all mock implementations
- Updated test setup to use real API calls with proper environment variables

### 2. Test Performance Optimizations
- Added performance improvements to the logical fallacy detector:
  - Early validation to fail fast on invalid inputs
  - Optimized fallacy detection loop to exit early when matches are found
  - Pre-computed lowercase text to avoid redundant operations

### 3. Memory and Resource Management
- Increased memory allocation to 8GB with `--max-old-space-size=8192` option
- Added garbage collection with `--expose-gc` flag
- Limited test concurrency with `--runInBand` option to reduce resource contention
- Configured test timeout to 60 seconds to accommodate API latency

### 4. Configuration Updates
- Updated Jest configuration with optimized settings
- Fixed TypeScript import issues in the setupTests.ts file
- Created specialized run scripts for Windows and Unix environments
- Added specific test script for the logical fallacy detector

## Running the Optimized Tests

### Windows Environments
```batch
# Run all tests optimized for Windows
npm run test:win

# Run only the logical fallacy detector test
test-fallacy-detector.bat
```

### Unix Environments
```bash
# Run all tests with optimizations
npm run test:optimized

# Run specific test with optimizations
./run-tests-optimized.sh
```

## Resolving Specific Issues

### Command Execution Timeout (Exit Code 143)
This issue was resolved by:
1. Increasing the test timeout in Jest configuration
2. Optimizing code to reduce execution time
3. Running tests with `--runInBand` to avoid resource contention
4. Adding proper garbage collection with `--expose-gc`

### TypeScript Import Issues
Resolved by:
1. Adding proper imports for Jest globals: `import { jest, beforeAll, afterAll } from '@jest/globals';`
2. Ensuring proper TypeScript configurations

## Verification Results

The logical fallacy detector test now runs successfully:

```
PASS src/tools/__tests__/logical_fallacy_detector.test.ts
  Logical Fallacy Detector
    √ should detect ad hominem fallacy (6 ms)
    √ should detect appeal to authority fallacy (2 ms)
    √ should return no fallacies for well-reasoned text (1 ms)
    √ should respect confidence threshold (2 ms)
    √ should filter fallacies by category (1 ms)

## Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor memory and CPU usage during tests
2. **Focused Testing**: Use specific test runners for resource-intensive tests
3. **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling in API-dependent code
4. **Test Isolation**: Keep API-dependent tests isolated from fast-running unit tests

These optimizations allow tests to properly utilize real API dependencies without falling back to mocks while addressing performance and resource constraints.
