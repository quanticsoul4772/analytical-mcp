# Updating to Latest MCP SDK Patterns

This document outlines the changes made to update the analytical-mcp-server to use the latest MCP SDK (v1.0.1) patterns.

## Changes Applied

### 1. Server Initialization

- Updated server initialization to use capabilities directly instead of methods
- Improved error handling and logging for better diagnostic capabilities
- Added defensive programming techniques to gracefully handle missing components

### 2. Tool Registration

- Changed from `server.methods.tools.register()` to `server.capabilities.tools.register()`
- Added proper type definitions for MCP tool handlers
- Enhanced error handling during tool registration
- Added performance metrics (execution time tracking)

### 3. TypeScript Configuration 

- Added stricter type checking with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `noImplicitAny`
- Enabled source maps and declaration files for better debugging
- Added `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` for more precise type checking

### 4. Tool Wrapper

- Improved error handling with more detailed logging
- Added performance metrics for execution timing
- Enhanced type safety with explicit generic type parameters

## How to Apply the Updates

1. Run the provided batch file:
   ```
   update-to-latest-mcp.bat
   ```

2. Install dependencies and rebuild:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. Test the server:
   ```
   node build/index.js
   ```

## Working with the Updated Server

The updated server uses the latest MCP SDK patterns and requires changes in how you register and use tools. Key differences:

1. **Server Initialization**: Use `server.capabilities.tools` instead of `server.methods.tools`

2. **Tool Registration**: Tools are registered directly with the capabilities object

3. **Error Handling**: Enhanced error handling with better logging and diagnostic information

4. **Type Safety**: Stricter type checking for better reliability

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors:

1. Check the error messages for references to specific files or lines
2. Make sure all imports use the `.js` extension even in TypeScript files
3. Verify that all tools conform to the new registration pattern
4. Check that type definitions are correct for all functions

If the server fails to start:

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Verify that environment variables are correctly set
3. Make sure all dependencies are installed
4. Check for TypeScript compilation errors

## Reverting Changes

If needed, you can revert to the original files from the backups in `src/backups/`.
