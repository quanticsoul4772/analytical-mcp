# Analytical MCP Server Example Use Cases

## Research Verification Scenarios

### 1. Climate Change Research Validation

**Scenario:** Verify claims about climate change from multiple sources

```typescript
const researchResult = await verifyResearch({
  query: 'Global warming impact on sea levels',
  verificationQueries: [
    'Climate change ocean level rise',
    'Sea level increase scientific evidence'
  ],
  sources: 5,
  minConsistencyThreshold: 0.75
});

// Output includes:
// - Verified research findings
// - Confidence score
// - Source consistency details
```

### 2. Medical Treatment Effectiveness

**Scenario:** Cross-validate research about a medical treatment

```typescript
const medicalResearch = await verifyResearch({
  query: 'Effectiveness of new cancer treatment',
  verificationQueries: [
    'Latest cancer therapy clinical trials',
    'Patient outcomes in cancer research'
  ],
  sources: 4,
  minConsistencyThreshold: 0.8
});

// Provides:
// - Aggregated research insights
// - Confidence in research claims
// - Identification of consistent vs. conflicting information
```

### 3. Technology Trend Analysis

**Scenario:** Research emerging technological trends

```typescript
const techTrendResearch = await verifyResearch({
  query: 'Artificial Intelligence advancements in 2024',
  verificationQueries: [
    'Latest AI technology breakthroughs',
    'Machine learning innovation trends'
  ],
  sources: 6,
  minConsistencyThreshold: 0.7
});

// Outputs:
// - Consolidated trend insights
// - Research source credibility
// - Emerging technology patterns
```

## Analytical Tool Integration Examples

### Combining Research Verification with Statistical Analysis

```typescript
// Research trend insights
const researchResult = await verifyResearch({
  query: 'Economic growth in developing countries'
});

// Perform statistical analysis on extracted data
const economicData = extractNumericData(researchResult.verifiedResults);
const dataAnalysis = await analyzeDataset({
  data: economicData
});

// Comprehensive insights combining research verification and statistical analysis
```

### Decision Analysis with Research-Backed Insights

```typescript
// Verify research on market strategies
const marketResearch = await verifyResearch({
  query: 'Successful startup strategies',
  sources: 5
});

// Use verified insights for decision analysis
const strategicOptions = marketResearch.verifiedResults.map(insight => ({
  name: insight,
  description: 'Strategy derived from verified research'
}));

const decisionAnalysis = await decisionAnalysis({
  options: strategicOptions,
  criteria: [
    { name: 'Innovation Potential', weight: 0.4 },
    { name: 'Market Adaptability', weight: 0.6 }
  ]
});
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use multiple verification queries
2. Adjust consistency threshold based on research domain
3. Combine research verification with other analytical tools
4. Consider the confidence score when making decisions
5. Use a diverse range of sources for comprehensive insights

## Limitations and Considerations

- Research verification depends on available sources
- Confidence scoring is a probabilistic approach
- Results may vary based on query specificity
- Recommended to use in conjunction with domain expertise
