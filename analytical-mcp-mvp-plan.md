## Total Timeline: Ongoing Development

### Key Strategy Points:
1. Prioritize tools over resources
2. Use mock data for MVP
3. Minimal testing focused on tool functionality
4. Limited documentation covering demo requirements

### Post-MVP Priorities (Ongoing)
- [ ] [6.1] Add real data integration
- [ ] [6.2] Implement additional analytical tools
- [ ] [6.3] Add advanced resource support
- [ ] [6.4] Improve error handling and logging
- [ ] [6.5] Create more comprehensive documentation
