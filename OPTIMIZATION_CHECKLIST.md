# Test Optimization Checklist

This checklist provides verification steps to ensure that API-dependent tests are running optimally.

## ✅ Configuration Verification

- [x] **API Keys**: All required API keys are set in system environment variables
- [x] **Test Timeout**: Increased to 60+ seconds in setupTests.ts
- [x] **Memory Allocation**: Set to 8GB with `--max-old-space-size=8192`
- [x] **Test Mode**: Using `--runInBand` to prevent concurrent API calls
- [x] **TypeScript Configuration**: Jest globals properly imported

## ✅ Code Optimization

- [x] **Early Validation**: Added input validation to fail fast on invalid data
- [x] **Pattern Matching**: Optimized with early returns when matches are found
- [x] **Memory Usage**: Pre-computed values to reduce redundant operations
- [x] **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for API operations

## ✅ Test Infrastructure

- [x] **Specialized Scripts**: Created dedicated scripts for API-heavy tests
- [x] **Windows Support**: Added batch files and Windows-specific npm scripts
- [x] **Unix Support**: Added shell scripts for Unix environments
- [x] **CI Configuration**: Updated with optimized test settings

## ✅ Documentation

- [x] **API Testing Guide**: Created comprehensive guide for API testing
- [x] **Optimization Checklist**: This document for verification
- [x] **Test Strategy**: Updated to reflect real API usage approach

## Verification Steps

1. **Logical Fallacy Detector Test**
   - [x] Test runs without timeout
   - [x] All assertions pass
   - [x] No memory issues reported

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - [x] Test execution time is reasonable (under 3 seconds)
   - [x] No excessive memory usage
   - [x] Test completes without errors

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add monitoring for API usage during tests
- [ ] Implement smarter API call batching
- [ ] Add more targeted test cases for specific API features
- [ ] Create automated API health check before tests

## Maintaining Optimizations

When adding new API-dependent functionality:

1. Follow the patterns established in the logical fallacy detector
2. Implement early validation and efficient algorithms
3. Use the optimized test scripts for running tests
4. Update this checklist with any new optimizations

By following these guidelines, you can ensure the Analytical MCP Server maintains optimal performance for API-dependent tests.
